# Readme Generator

  ## Description
  The readme generator helps make a professional readme for any project you may need. It gives you a prompt of questions that makes it simpler to oragnize your thoughts. It asks you for a title, description, motivation, and many more details on your project. Once you answer the questions prompted it will automatically create a proefessional looking readme. 
  
  ## Motivation
  My motivation to create this project was to find a better solution to generate a readme. They can be time consuming sometimes, so this app allows it to be very quick and effecient because it guides you through it.
